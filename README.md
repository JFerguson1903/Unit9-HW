## Description

I was given the assignment through Triliogy/WASHU Coding Bootcamp to create an open source "command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package". The user story was that, "AS A developer I WANT a README generator SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project".

The additional acceptance criteria was as follows:

- WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
- WHEN I enter my project title THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
- WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
- WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
- WHEN I enter my GitHub username THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
- WHEN I enter my email address THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
- WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
