## Description

I was given the assignment through Triliogy/WASHU Coding Bootcamp to create an application that "allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code".  Additionally the app was to run in the brower and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The user story was that, "AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner SO THAT I can manage my time effectively".

The additional acceptance criteria was as follows:

- WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
- WHEN I enter my project title THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
- WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
- WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
- WHEN I enter my GitHub username THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
- WHEN I enter my email address THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
- WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
